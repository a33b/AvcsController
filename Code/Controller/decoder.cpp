/*
This file contains the various crank and cam wheel decoder functions.

Each decoder must have the following 4 functions (Where xxxx is the decoder name):

* triggerSetup_xxx - Called once from within setup() and configures any required variables
* triggerPri_xxxx - Called each time the primary (No. 1) crank/cam signal is triggered (Called as an interrupt, so variables must be declared volatile)
* triggerSec_xxxx - Called each time the secondary (No. 2) crank/cam signal is triggered (Called as an interrupt, so variables must be declared volatile)
* getRPM_xxxx - Returns the current RPM, as calculated by the decoder
* getCrankAngle_xxxx - Returns the current crank angle, as calculated b the decoder

And each decoder must utlise at least the following variables:
toothLastToothTime - The time (In uS) that the last primary tooth was 'seen'

This is a special case of RPM measure that is based on the time between the last 2 teeth rather than the time of the last full revolution
This gives much more volatile reading, but is quite useful during cranking, particularly on low resolution patterns.
It can only be used on patterns where the teeth are evently spaced
It takes an argument of the full (COMPLETE) number of teeth per revolution. For a missing tooth wheel, this is the number if the tooth had NOT been missing (Eg 36-1 = 36)
