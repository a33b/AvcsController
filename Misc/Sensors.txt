Exhaust cam sensors have 3 wires
+12v
Ground
Signal - normally high, pulled low when triggered.

Signal output goes through a 100 ohm resistor, then is clamped to 3.3v with a zener diode to ground, then goes through a 200 ohm resistor and into the Arduino input pin.

Plan to use either the IPW Signal to the cluster (economy) or might highjack an output fromt the ECU? Ideally use CAN for an IPW signal
